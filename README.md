## Instructions

#### Requirements

It is recommended to install XAMPP, since it contains all the required software to run the app. You can download it [here](https://www.apachefriends.org).
Otherwise, you will need to install the following software (it can also be done with Homebrew):

- [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- [Apache web server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [MySQL 8.0](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

Additionally, the web app was made using *phpMyAdmin* to manage the database (already included in XAMPP). If you want to use it, you can download it [here](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/).

#### Installation

The repository contains the database file `beerdb.sql` and the web app files. To install the web app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Start the Apache web server and MySQL.
3. Create a database named `cervezas`.
4. Import the file `beerdb.sql` into the database.
5. Create a file named `src/config.php` and define the constants `$Host`, `$User`, `$Password`, `$Database` and `$Port` to match your database configuration (or assign the values directly in `src/dbConnection.php`).
